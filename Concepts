STORY(or what little of it there is): Some kid stumbles upon an abandoned factory

TITLE SCREEN: Kid stands in front of the factory.  Pressing start opens the factory door and the kid enters

STRUCTURES

Doors will spawn on the left and right in any of 5 spots on the wall.  
They spawn with 2 tiles in front of them

Lines of 3-5 tiles can be literally anywhere in the room. 
If the closest tile line is more than 4(not final, as it will be based off of jump height) tiles away vertically/horizantally, a ladder spawns

Crates, holding health, can spawn in the middle of a tile line.(maximun of 2 per room)

Turrets spawn on the underside of a tile 8 tiles from the bottom of the room.
They do massive damage.(max of 1 a room) Enemies can take control of it.  
(Not concrete)When this happens, the player can destroy the turret, or get far enough away from it to get the enemy out of it
If the turret survives the round, the player can demantle it for parts to upgrade weapon.

ENEMIES

Slimes are the most basic enemy in the game.  They really only hop around and cannot use turrets.
